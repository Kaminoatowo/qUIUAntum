There is the [uiua-math](https://github.com/Omnikar/uiua-math) ([website](https://omnikar.github.io/uiua-math/)) module by [Omnikar](https://github.com/Omnikar) where there are many mathematical functions already implemented in UIUA and may turn out to be more efficient than functions I may implement myself
